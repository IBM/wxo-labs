## Lab

**[Document Processing](wxo%20Document%20Processing.pdf)**

In this lab, you will implement a simplified version of the Document Processing Workflow used in the Solution to extract quote information received from vendors when users order a part not in the catalog. In the simplified version of the Document processing Workflow, you will use the advanced document processing features of wxO and Generative AI.

You will follow these steps to create a Workflow that extracts supplier names and prices from quotes received from multiple potential suppliers:
1.	Add relevant skills that you will use in this lab to your personal skillset
2.	Create a Generative AI skill to extract the supplier name and quote amount from quote documents
3.	Create a document processing workflow
4.	Test the Workflow
