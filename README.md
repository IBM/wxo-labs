# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Tech Jam Labs

The IBM watsonx Orchestrate Tech Jam features a simplified version of a unique solution (called IT Accessory Hub) for Focus Corp employees to order IT accessories, which is part of the wider procurement domain. Although intended to be realistic, it is fictitious, simplified, and meant to showcase key aspects of IBM watsonx Orchestrate (wxO) easily and quickly.

To be able to perform these labs, you need to have access to an IBM watsonx Orchestrate Instance with preconfigured assets for the IT Accessory Hub scenario that is connected to an IT Accessory Hub system of record.
